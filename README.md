# 🌌 Kinematic Realms
Kinematic Realms is an interactive 3D physics simulation developed in Unity. It allows users to explore the fundamental principles of velocity and acceleration through visually intuitive and engaging experiments. The simulation includes a sleek Main Menu UI, letting users choose between multiple kinematic scenarios and guiding them through each experiment.

## 🎮 Features

🌐 Main Menu UI – Navigate the simulation using a clean and responsive interface.

🚀 Acceleration Experiments – Simulate and observe how objects speed up over time under different forces.

🏃 Velocity Experiments – Track and compare linear motion under constant or changing speeds.

🧪 Real-time Visualization – View position, velocity, and acceleration in world space through live graphs and UI labels.

🕹️ Interactive Control – Pause, reset, and modify experiment variables (like force or mass) mid-simulation.

## 🕹️ How to Operate
After launching the project in Unity:

### 1. Main Menu
You'll start at the Main Menu, which offers buttons to:

Start Simulation – Opens the experiment selection.

Instructions – Learn how the system works.

Exit – Closes the application (desktop builds only).

### 2. Selecting an Experiment
Choose between:

Velocity Lab – Simulate uniform or varying speed motion.

Acceleration Lab – Experiment with different forces and observe motion changes.

### 3. Running the Simulation
Use the on-screen controls to:

Start / Pause – Toggle simulation playback.

Reset – Reset the current experiment.

Modify Parameters – Change variables like object mass, force applied, or friction.

View Data – Enable/disable on-screen graphs showing velocity and acceleration over time.

### 4. Returning to Main Menu
Press the Back button in the top-left to return to the main menu and switch experiments.
